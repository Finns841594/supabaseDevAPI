# supabase Minimal Developer API
This is a minimal API using the C# Supabase Client. The project was built as a proof of concept for a mob-programming project and allows for operations on a selected Supabase Table, with the addition of the requisite Supabase Url and API key as env variables where noted.

## The Models

The table in question contained a model for the table items as:
- Id - int (primary key within the table)
- Name - String
- Email - String
- CreatedAt - DateTime

The progam also includes contracts for the DTOs based on requests and responses relating to the above model.

## The Routes

All routes are based on the /jobdescriptions endpoints.  The following operations are contained within the API:

- GET - /devs/ - returns a list of all developers.
- GET - /devs/{id} - returns the developer identified.
- POST - /devs - adds a developers based on the request and returns the developer's id generated by the table.
- PUT - /devs/{id} - updates the developer identified.
- DELETE - /devs/{id} - deletes the selected developer.

## Next Steps

Proposed next steps are to build the API as a webcontroller, to move the project to a more Modular Monolith architectural style.
